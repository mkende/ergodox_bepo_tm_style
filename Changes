Changelog for the bépo "TypeMatrix style" layout for the Ergodox EZ keyboard

v11 - ??
 - Fix the paste command that was invalid under windows/linux (bug in v10).

v10 - 2025-11-29
 - Add an "OS LEDS" layer (on FN + sysleds) to show the currently detected OS.
 - Add a keyboard reboot key on F11 in the OS LEDS layer.
 - Update the "start" and "end" keys on a Mac layout to emit ctrl + arrow
   instead of the actual keys, so that the behavior is coherent with other
   systems.

v9 - 2025-11-02
 - Add a shortcut to print ``` on FN+è (to help with markdown) as this otherwise
   requires a total of 9 key presses (if done with that dead-key)!

v8 - 2025-10-22
 - Fix the copy/paste shortcut on the MacOS variant.
 - Drop the MacOS variant and use OS detection instead to use the correct
   shortcuts.
 - Drop the no_sleep variant and instead use OS detection to emit the correct
   sleep shortcut.
 - Create a left_handed variant that swaps the Macro and Hand-Swap keys, so that
   the keyboard can be used with the right hand only.

v7 - 2025-10-12
 - Different tuning of the mouse keys
 - Adding support for the stm32 Ergodox EZ
 - Adding the macos variant (using different copy/paste shortcut)
 - Improve support of the caps word function (also trigger in the MOUSE layer
   and "capitalize numbers).

v6 - 2024-05-10
 - Add a caps lock key on the right shift key (within they NUM layer).
 - Add a key that prints the current version of the firmware (tab key in the NUM
   layer).
 - Switch the keymap to be defined using bépo string.
